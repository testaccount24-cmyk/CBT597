Hello Mr Golob,

I visit the CBT-site a lot. I did find a lot of helpful freeware
which saved us a lot of money. So thank You for that.

At the moment I am also using the MPF-exit MPFXTALL from CBT345.
I was very pleased about it's simpleness. But now I encounter
A37-008 abends on this exit. Do you know whether there is a newer
version available or maybe an elegant replacement  for this exit?
(I am running OS390 2.10 at the moment.)
