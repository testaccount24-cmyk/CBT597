Hi Sam,

Nice to know that you are still working on my problem.  We solved
it using a even more elegant way (my personal opinion).

We combined two things:
First a collegea (with assembler skills) did write an very simple
new MPF-exit named MPFCMDS. This exit just issue's a command "S
MPFCMDS,MBR=<msgid>".  (Even I am able to maintain this exit with
my limited Assembler skills!)

I also created a proc called "MPFCMDS":

//MPFCMDS  PROC MEMBER=DUMMY
//MPFCMDS  EXEC PGM=COMMAND
//IEFRDER  DD DSN=MVS.MEGA.MPFCMDS(&MEMBER.),DISP=SHR

The PDS contains just like before the commands to issue when a
particular message occurs.

I did use the program COMMAND  (found at cbt) because it has the
extra features like "DELAY", "IFSTARTED" ... The proc could also
be any other command executing program.

If you are interested I could send the sources to you!

Greetings,

Hans

     Hi Hans,

        My "error message list" says that an A37-008 means that the
     Data Extent Block does not point to the DCB.

        This means that a field in the DEB (the one that is supposed to
     point to the DCB) is missing.  Please look at whatever output you
     can get, to determine what ddname this is for.  The we can look
     into the code that opens the ddname (maybe) and see if there is
     some problem with the open.  The MPF exit code does open the file
     which contains the list of commands to be dealt with.  If that is
     the dataset that we're dealing with, then we can possibly fix the
     program.

        Please try and gather this evidence, if you can.

        All the best.....

     Met vriendelijke groeten,
     Sam Golob
